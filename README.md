# Getting Started

```
$ npm i

> if you get stuck somewhere or get an error, please create an issue

### Let's customize

#### Enabling Dark theme

To enable dark theme just provide `--dark` as an argument while building

```
$ node build --name username --dark
```

#### Customize background image

To customize the background image just provide `--background [url]` argument while building

```
$ node build --name username --background https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557277770-baf0ca74f908?w=1634
```

You could also add in your custom CSS inside `index.css` to give it a more personal feel.


### Let's Publish

You can host your website using github pages and use a custom domain aswell or simply use `username.github.io`.


### Updating

### Add a Blog

To add your first blog run this command, make sure the title don't have spaces.

This also adds content to `blog.json` file. This file helps in showcasing your blogs on your personal website as cards. You could customize the JSON object that corresponds your current blog.

Default JSON Format
```
{
  "url_title": "my-first-blog", // the title you provide while creating a new blog
  "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", // main title of blog
  "sub_title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.", // sub-title of blog
  "top_image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553748024-d1b27fb3f960?w=1450", // main image of blog
  "visible": true // don't worry about this
