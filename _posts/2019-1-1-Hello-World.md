Hello World!

This is the first of hopefully many dev blog posts.  I've never had a dev blog before so we'll see how it goes.

What I am currently working on:

* Heart Beast's 2D Hack-n-Slash course, just finished part 17, starting on 18.
* Taking lessons learned in the tutorials and applying it to my fracture game.

I'm going to try and have images coming up next week!
