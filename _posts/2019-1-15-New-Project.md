title: New Project!
---

So this weekend I started a new project, something to help supplement my workflow of VSCode markdown and syncing with git for my writing.  I'm using it to start in on Xamarin.  

As far as the Game Jam is going, slow work on that.  Lots of things happened personally that have just eaten up all of my time.  But next week I should have more time to work on it.

As far as other projects, I recently found an old RPG setting notebook in Evernote and uploaded it a few weeks ago.  [The Disk](https://github.com/herrozerro/The-Disk-Setting) is an unfinished setting for the cypher system.  I've been poking at it too, going to try to finish it up this year sometime.

That's about it for this week!
