title: Keeping up the pace
---

The first week of the new year is off to a blistering start!  I've been continuing Heart Beast's 2d Hack and Slash tutorial.  Completed Part 24, adding a second enemy, added XP and a few other items.

Other things going on; for our monthly developer meetup myself and a coworker are going to be running a series for the next few months, getting a .net core app to run on a Pi.

Also started work on a game for the [Gaming like it's 1923 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1923).

Until next time.
