So, this week a took another look around the app store and found an app for a few dollars, turns out it does what I need, except for having a built in editor.  

What this means for the project?  Well I am still going to keep on working on it.  But now that I have a working workflow for myself I can focus on getting it right.  I've been looking at alternatives to Xamarin.  Perhaps react native or other solutions.  Or maybe just biting the bullet and going with Android studio.  We'll see!
