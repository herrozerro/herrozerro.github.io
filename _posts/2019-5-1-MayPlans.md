It's been a long time since my last update, but I have been chugging along with my projects.  I've been messing around with Blazor lately and see a lot of promise in it now that MS has committed to it.

But other than that, I've been working more on fiction and world building than code lately.  But maybe I'll find some time this month to code as well.
